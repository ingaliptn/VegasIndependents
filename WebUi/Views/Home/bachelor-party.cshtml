                        It's not clear why we 'fall' in love rather than 'rise' in love. We still say
                        'sunrise' and 'sunset' even though it has been clear since a few centuries
                        that it's the rotation of the Earth that creates the phenomenon. We keep
                        things simple. That seems to be the reason behind usages such as sunrise and
                        sunset. It's still not clear what is with the 'fall' rather than the 'rise.'
                        What gives?

                        Marriage between humans is one hoary tradition going back several thousands
                        of years. It has been prevalent in all human cultures. Though, to be sure,
                        there are variations among cultures with polygamy prevalent in some
                        cultures. The dominant kind of marriage today happens to be between one man
                        and one woman. One of the recent innovations surrounding the whole marriage
                        thing in the United States is the bachelor party. The idea being that the
                        groom-to-be gets to enjoy some adult entertainment and generally has a
                        wildly fun time before he takes the plunge into married life which is
                        supposed to be vastly different from single or bachelor life.

                        Where does one go to have fun? While there are many cities in the U.S. with
                        bars, restaurants and clubs, Las Vegas takes it to the next level with the
                        sheer variety and gargantuan scale of the entertainment.

                        Sin City turns out to be the destination for most bachelor parties. It's the
                        Mecca of adult entertainment. So, if you want to find everything in one
                        place — escorts, strip clubs, topless bars, adult shows, cars, casinos,
                        fighter jets, massage parlors and more — than look no further than Las
                        Vegas.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        No matter what your wedding plans maybe, the bachelor party has to be located
                        in Las Vegas. In an age of much political polarization, you could say that
                        this is one of those rare things about which there will be large-scale
                        consensus and unanimity across political divisions. Whatever your views
                        about economic policy, immigration or vaccines, you will likely enjoy the
                        variety of fun available for men in Vegas.

                        It's mindboggling how in a few short centuries, our hobbies and entertainment
                        options have changed from cockfights and bullfights (involving pitbulls) to
                        workouts on Pelotons and streaming shows on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+,
                        Hulu and Apple TV.

                    <p>
                        Imagine if you had a time machine and went to the 19th century and tried
                        explaining to them what an Instagram influencer was or how some people got
                        millions of followers on YouTube by creating videos about their dogs or by
                        cooking videos.

                    <p>
                        It's helpful to put things in context and realize that we are living in the
                        best of times and things in the 'old days' were actually much worse and we
                        have the best of everything and we can access amazing technologies with very
                        little money — think of 4G smartphones or air travel.

                    <p>
                        In the midst of all this change, some things have remained more or less
                        constant. Men are interested in women today just as they have been since
                        centuries. Men like the company of women. Men love looking at pretty women.
                        Men are attracted towards scantily clad women or semi-naked women. Above
                        all, men love looking at naked women.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>All these male desires have led to strip clubs and escort services.</p><br />
                    <p>
                        Las Vegas naturally has some of the best strip clubs and escort service
                        providers.

                        Your Las Vegas bachelor party will be incomplete without hiring Las Vegas

                    <h2>Setting The Contours of A Great Las Vegas Bachelor Party</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are arbitrary people with arbitrary ‘rules’ or customs. Women have taken
                        to wearing sexy bikinis and thongs and G-strings in the last few decades.
                        Our contemporary clothing or fashion paradigm is certainly a far cry from
                        centuries ago. Diamonds have become an essential part of wedding rituals
                        only in recent decades thanks to clever marketing by a company that benefits
                        from high diamond prices.

                        Bachelor parties are a new tradition associated with marriage and bachelor
                        parties have developed their own rules and grammar. These are common sense
                        notions that any bachelor party planner should keep in mind.
                    </p><br />

                        <li>
                            The bachelor party should keep the groom's interests in mind. Though to
                            be honest, most heterosexual men will have predictable interests in
                            terms of sexy ladies, topless beauties, and so forth. Men may have
                            different levels of interest in alcohol or sports and the party planner
                            needs to plan accordingly.

                        <li>
                            It seems obvious to say that the bachelor party should be fun. But the
                            planning needs to take into account aspects of the trip so that there
                            are only a reasonable number of activities with hopefully no glitches.
                            Keeping things smooth over a weekend of activity is not an
                            insurmountable challenge. Once everything goes well, the whole trip will
                            remain a memorable occasion in everyone's memory forever.

                            A Las Vegas bachelor party is incomplete without Las Vegas escorts.
                            Other entertainment options include Las Vegas bachelor party strippers.
                            The party planner needs to take on board everyone's boundaries. So, some
                            things may be 'off-limits' such as recreational marijuana or some sort
                            of private shows by the escorts.

                    <p>
                        Once you decide on the broad outlines of your bachelor party in Las Vegas,
                        you can decide on the details of the activities to be included in your
                        party. It's about having a strategy and then adopting the right tactics.

                        The things to keep in mind regarding a bachelor party in Las Vegas have to do
                        with aspects such as money, time, and location.

                        Being Money Wise — A Las Vegas Bachelor Party That Suze Orman Might Approve
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        You and your buddies belong to different professions — could be traditional
                        vocations such as the law and medicine or other newer endeavors such as IT
                        and data science. If you are like most people, you enjoy the things that
                        most others do – watching fun movies or reading good books. You love to
                        explore the latest gadgets and try out new things and new cuisines. Our
                        living standards have improved immensely over the centuries though incomes
                        have stagnated for middle class folks in recent decades. People are cutting
                        back on vacations and prioritizing their spending. But when you make a
                        careful cost-benefit analysis, bachelor parties should make the cut. An
                        occasional splurging is something even Suze Orman will approve of!
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        As the bachelor party planner, you research the costs of the different
                        activities and the things which need to be purchased — the shows, the
                        activities, the strip shows and the private hiring of strippers, the food
                        and the booze and so forth — and then add them all up and divide the grand
                        total by the number of participants in the bachelor party. You get a
                        ballpark figure for how much everyone can expect to spend.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        This should be a reasonable amount that everyone can afford on their incomes.
                        You should be upfront about this expense rather than lowballing it.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        You should assume that there will be additional 'spur-of-the-moment' expenses
                        which will make the cost of the trip about 20% higher than estimated.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        You should opt for expensive options only when that is absolutely essential.
                        Men will mostly look at taking care of their hunger when it comes to lunch
                        and dinner. So, you can save on the costs of ultra-expensive fine dining
                        options.

                        You can wear tan suits without causing a minor hullabaloo unlike what

                    <p>
                        When you are planning a busy weekend in Vegas, you don't want to be stuck
                        outside restaurants for seats to become available. Nor do you want to be
                        kept outside other busy establishments.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        The key to avoid loss such of time is to do advance booking of tickets when
                        it's something really important and which you don't want to miss.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        If it's something not so important — such as a restaurant — you should have a
                        couple of backups which you have already researched. If your primary option
                        turns out to be unavailable, you immediately hotfoot it to the next option
                        which should be nearby.

                    <h3>Getting The Timing And Season Right</h3>
                    <p>
                        Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos got the timing right as did Mark
                        Zuckerberg. Elon Musk too got the timing right in terms of when to launch
                        electric vehicles as also with his rocket launch company, SpaceX. Of course,
                        there are lots of other factors and hard work and innovation and business
                        insights and risk-taking is also involved.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        With Vegas outings and Las Vegas bachelor party planning, it's important to
                        get your timing right. If you travel during peak holiday season, be prepared
                        to jostle with crowds including babies. People who normally make their way
                        to Disneyland are now landing up in Las Vegas.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        With so much crowding, you may find show tickets and restaurants to be
                        unusually expensive. This is among the top bachelor party tips to remember.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        The other timing issue has to do with the time of the day. Remember that the
                        top attractions at popular shows only perform during late evening prime time
                        hours.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        So, book yourselves at your favorite strip clubs and Circue du Soleil shows
                        only during prime times.

                    <p>
                        A bachelor party in Las Vegas will be a fulfilling experience if you feel
                        like you spent a justifiable amount of money and had a great time without
                        wasting any of it in queues.

                        Men may have strong opinions on topics such as immigration or Obamacare but
                        most will agree about the benefits of spending time with beautiful ladies to
                        alleviate their physical or mental stresses. You could say that Las Vegas
                        escorts specializing in bachelor parties are a ‘propitious intervention’ so
                        far as stress reduction is concerned.

                        You got to get your location right. It applies to real estate projects,
                        rocket launch sites, corporate headquarters and much else.

                        Life today is much changed and much improved from the 19th century. We not
                        only live longer and take more breaths but we also have the opportunity to
                        have more breathtaking moments.

                    <p>
                        But when it comes to a Las Vegas bachelor party, you don't want to spend a
                        lot of time in walking from one end of the Strip to another.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        If your hotel rooms or suites are strategically located, all your
                        destinations will be within easy reach of you. You might even save on cab
                        fares.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        Once the location is set, you need to choose between hotel rooms and larger
                        suites. You should rent a suite or two to accommodate your buddies. This
                        will have many advantages not the least of which is that you can organize
                        some scintillating shows by some of our sizzling hot sexy sirens, i.e. our
                        Las Vegas escorts specializing in bachelor parties.

                        Our specialized bachelor party escorts are better professionals than most
                        dancers and strippers you would see at the typical venues.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        With a suite at your disposal, you can enjoy drinks without paying exorbitant
                        bar rates and their minimum charges and so forth.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        You are safe from obnoxious, uncouth and/or inebriated patrons when you are
                        enjoying a private show by our spectacular Las Vegas bachelor party
                        strippers.

                    <p>
                        But you are not 'safe' from the sizzling hot performances by our sexy
                        maidens. If it gets 'too hot to handle' for some of your more conservative
                        buddies, they can easily withdraw from the show while the rest of the party
                        continues.

                        Almost a century ago, Amelia Earhart was wise and foresighted enough to have
                        written to her husband to be: “On our life together I want you to understand
                        I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I
                        consider myself bound to you similarly. If we can be honest I think the
                        difficulties which arise may best be avoided should you or I become
                        interested deeply (or in passing) in anyone else.” She added: “I cannot
                        guarantee to endure at all times the confinements of even an attractive
                        cage.”

                        Scholars debate whether Henry David Thoreau had carnal pleasures and physical
                        relations with any man or woman in his entire life. And that was the man who
                        wrote a two-million-word journal about his experience of living in complete

                        After all, you can still arguably enjoy and partake of some of the other

                        When you consider whether to hire professional Las Vegas escorts from escort
                        agencies versus hiring independent escorts, your decision needs to take into
                        consideration more than just the hourly rates or fees. Independent escorts
                        might appear to be the cheaper option on the face of it, but you run the
                        risk of running into unprofessional operators. With independent operators,
                        you have no recourse to get a redressal of your grievances.

                    <p>
                        With escorts from established escort agencies, you get assured service. So,
                        even if these are more expensive, you should only hire from the best.

                    <p>
                        With established escort agencies with websites, you can be sure that you are
                        dealing with licensed operators and with escorts who have their licenses
                        obtained through proper channels.

                    <p>
                        Since escorts may be the centerpiece of your entire trip, you should opt for
                        premium quality. You can look for deals and discounts in hotel suites and
                        all-you-can-eat buffet services and that's perfectly logical.

                        <li>
                            <strong>The Shows Have It. </strong> Las Vegas may not have a historic
                            district or art district or world-famous museums, but its shows are
                            world-class and world-famous. None more so than Cirque du Soleil which
                            has more charms than can be expressed in words and needs to be
                            experienced in person. This eye-popping spectacle comprising comedy,
                            burlesque and high wire acts, and circus will give you a sense that time
                            flies! Other Vegas shows include Absinthe inside Spiegelworld's at
                            Caesars Palace. You can enjoy these shows along with your buddies or you
                            can hire a few Las Vegas escorts to come along for fun. Just remember
                            that advance booking of tickets would be well advised since these shows
                            tend to be fully booked — especially during peak hours in peak seasons
                            and on weekends and during holiday seasons. More and more people from
                            America and around the world are visiting Vegas to experience its unique
                            attractions.

                            <strong>The Strip Clubs Flaunt It. </strong> Las Vegas strip clubs are
                            among the primary reasons that millions are hooked to Vegas. While you
                            must take your bachelor party buddies to one or more of these strip
                            clubs, ample prior research is called for to choose your shows and
                            choose your timings. You don't want to overstretch your budget. Many
                            strip clubs will have themed rooms and offer private shows to patrons
                            for generous fees. Talking of budgets, it might make sense to hire your
                            own Las Vegas bachelor party strippers to do shows for you and your
                            buddies in the privacy and exclusivity of your hotel suite.

                            <strong>Do You Have 'The Right Stuff'? </strong> It takes years of
                            training before men (and women) become fighter aircraft pilots. You can
                            just pay a fee to one of the licensed fighter jet operators in Vegas and
                            go for a spin in the air. You need not be a Larry Ellison or Richard
                            Branson to fulfill your boyhood dreams. Enjoy your Top Gun moment as you
                            take to the skies with an instructor in the seat behind you. Experience
                            some of what actual pilots go through as the G-forces hit you as you go
                            through rolls and spins. You'll even experience some stalls and
                            dogfights. These are about the most fun things you can do in the air
                            this side of Zero-G flights and suborbital flights.

                            <strong>Do You Love to Drive Supercars? </strong> We know that the
                            answer is "yes" in 99 percent cases. You and your buddies can drive some
                            spectacular supercars without the trouble and cost of owning them.
                            Whatever the supercar of your dreams — Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche,
                            McLaren, Dodge, and more — you can get your hands behind their wheels
                            after proper training. Supercars are in a different leagues from your
                            average Toyota or humdrum Honda — there are anywhere from 500 to 800
                            horses under the hood — and so you get proper instruction by
                            professionals who'll be in the front passenger seat as you take your
                            supercar for a spin around the Las Vegas Motor Speedway up north of the
                            Strip. If you are a racing fan, you'll love driving a Huracan, a
                            Helicat, a Panamera, or a 911. You can also experience the ultimate
                            thrill of being driven around the circuit by a professional racer who
                            pushes the car to its limit while you are in the passenger seat.

                            <strong>Which One to Choose: Jet Skis or ATVs? </strong> There are
                            endless opportunities to explore the outdoors in America. Sample
                            America’s iconic Scenic Byways such as the Turquoise Trail or New
                            Mexico, the Lariat Loop of Colorado, or Scenic Byway 12 of Utah also
                            enchantingly named as “A Journey Through Time Scenic Byway.” Close to
                            Las Vegas, there is Lake Mead. You can do some Jet Ski driving on Lake
                            Mead. Don't forget your six packs or sunscreen. Just on the outskirts of
                            Vegas, you can do some dune surfing on ATVs. It's almost like going back
                            to your childhood. We are lucky to be living when we can give in to
                            ‘FOMO’ and ‘YOLO.’ So, you should experience all the things – whether
                            it’s being driven around the Nurburgring in a race car by a professional
                            race car driver or driving around the Indy 500 race track or driving jet
                            skis on Lake Mead or riding ATVs.

                            <strong>Ride in Style — Do You Prefer Limos or Rolls Royce? </strong>
                            Achieving Your Childhood Dreams is a wonderful thing to do, as those who
                            have watched Dr. Randy Pausch's Last Lecture will recall. Whether you
                            are a fan of Dr. Pausch or Dr. Paul Kalanithi or Christopher Hitchens,
                            you'll recognize that life can be unpredictable. When you are in Vegas
                            for a bachelor party, you might as well do everything in style including
                            travelling. Tour operators will let you rent a luxury bus or Rolls Royce
                            or a limo. You and your buddies can arrive in style at your Vegas
                            destinations. No need to feel like you just participated in the human
                            centipede Menorah on Conan O’Brien when you can feel like Dean Kamen
                            might have felt after he invented the Segway.

                            <strong>Take Off to The Grand Canyon. </strong> It's the grandest of
                            canyons and you should visit it in equally grand fashion. Instead of
                            spending five days hiking or river rafting, you can fit in a quick tour
                            of the majestic Grand Canyon by visiting it from the air. The aerial
                            view will offer a different perspective on the 277-mile long natural
                            wonder. It will make us humble and may even make us realize that Earth
                            is a truly magical place. We may visit other planets, but not settle on
                            those planets, yet. As Carl Sagan put it in Cosmos. While many things
                            are not as they should be in the world, romance still flourishes and it
                            is still magical and a way to make magical memories. The world is
                            complicated and there is extreme wealth inequality and robots might be
                            taking over large swaths of human activity but for now we can revel in
                            the fact that we have the opportunity for romantic encounters and we are
                            still romantics at heart.

                                Would You Play Poker or Try Out Some Craft Beer or Enjoy a Pool
                                Party?
                            </strong> If you want to try out some local brews, you can
                            research what is brewing in Vegas breweries these days and make your
                            appointments. Things have improved a lot in terms of local craft beers
                            in Las Vegas. Playing poker in Vegas is about as natural as honeybees
                            making honey. You should do your research to find a place near your
                            hotel room or suite that won't make too large a hole in your pocket. As
                            the adage goes, bet only what you can afford to lose. Hot pool parties
                            are a typical Vegas attraction that you probably don't want to miss. So,
                            you can make your choices or choose all three. It's all up to you and
                            what your buddies love most of all. We never said it was going to be

                            <strong>What Is Near Vegas And Also Grand But Not A Canyon? </strong>
                            The Grand Canyon is not the only spectacular natural vista accessible
                            from Vegas. Within an hour's drive away from Las Vegas, you'll find the
                            Valley of Fire and Red Rock Canyon (and its hiking and biking trails).
                            You could go explore Mount Charleston's bristlecone pines or Goldstrike
                            Canyon's five-mile roundtrip trek. More recreational destinations less
                            than an hour away from Las Vegas include the Spring Mountain National
                            Recreation Area, Mohave Preserve, Tule Springs Fossil Beds National
                            Monument, River Mountain Loop Trail, Zion National Park, and Desert
                            National Wildlife Refuge.

                            </strong> “Because we tend to reward others when they do well
                            and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to
                            the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically
                            punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them,” Danny
                            Kahneman. Men differ in diverse ways – they have different professions
                            and different hobbies. Some men like to understand human behavior and
                            read Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s research and are interested in
                            the ‘peak-end rule’ and ‘availability heuristics’ and can quote Kahneman
                            verbatim on ‘regression to the mean.' You can ponder on these
                            imponderables as you tee off at one of Vegas' several golf resorts. You
                            could spend some serene time thinking about things while lounging in a
                            cigar bar. You won't get much serenity in one of Vegas' superclubs
                            though. You could shoot some high powered weapons at one of Vegas'
                            several licensed shooting ranges. Shooting straight requires
                            concentration to take precise aim. It's an art and a skill worth
                            cultivating. Falling from 800+ feet can be frightening or an adrenaline
                            rush depending on your mental make-up. As you can see, there are endless
                            options when it comes to having fun in Las Vegas. The smart thing would
                            be to make some judicious 'culling' of the options and narrow them down
                            to a manageable bunch and not try and fit in everything into a weekend.
                            Overworking yourselves will only leave you feeling tired.

                        "People are not so complicated. Relationships between people are
                        complicated," Amos Tversky liked to say. And perhaps no relationship is more
                        complicated than the marital one.

                        The software operating in our brains is ancient as are the social circuits
                        which evolved while our ancestors were hunters and foragers for thousands of
                        years. “The need to interact with each other is one of the strongest
                        motivational forces that humans experience,” a recent article in The New
                        Yorker noted. “The flip side of an evolutionary obsession with social
                        interaction is a corresponding feeling of distress when it’s thwarted,” the
                        same article also noted. We feel heartbreak and desolation from isolation
                        and separation from other people and joy, exhilaration and contentment from
                        togetherness with other people or with our family, and from making new
                        connections. Marital relations among humans go back quite a long time though
                        we are not necessarily a monogamous species.

                        Calvin Trillin wrote about his ‘stratagem’ to persuade Alice, the future
                        'Mrs. Trillin' — merely try and attend the right party. But he also wrote so
                        that he could please her through writing and she was someone trained to
                        appreciate good writing and storytelling. When the husband and wife’s
                        careers or professions or intellectual interests aren’t so closely aligned,
                        it may be difficult for them to carry on a decades-long love affair like Mr.

                    </p><br />
                    <p>Here's how such a successful bachelor party might proceed.</p><br />
                    <p>
                        You and your buddies arrive at a sumptuous Vegas suite ready to embark on a
                        weekend of fun or simply three fun-filled weekdays. You start things off
                        with a few chilled beers — maybe even 'on the house.' You have requisitioned
                        some fine Las Vegas escorts specializing in bachelor parties from a reputed
                        escort agency and the ladies arrive on time. You can start on one of your
                        daytime activities. Maybe that supercar drive or ATV drive ... You could
                        take the escorts along in a luxury vehicle you have rented — a limo or a
                        luxury bus or a Rolls.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        You could have a working lunch once you are done with your first activity.
                        You could hire some Las Vegas bachelor party strippers for a fun-filled
                        early evening. Once the Sun goes down, you could indulge in more drinking
                        in-house or visit a bar before their peak rush hour. As the evening turns
                        into night, the fun only gets better.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        You could visit a late-night show for which you have wisely booked tickets in
                        advance. Dinner can be taken care of before attending the show.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        You could repeat this for the two or three days that you are in Vegas for
                        your bachelor party.

                        Our memories are imperfect. There is a lot of creative editing going on
                        inside our brains. And yet, we yearn to create as many fun memories as we
                        can. Over the centuries, men must have learned to gain fun and excitement
                        from a variety of activities.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        One thing is for sure: your Las Vegas bachelor party will become part of your
                        permanent memory.

                        If you are a sci-fi fan, you might love to imagine how a civilization spread
                        across the galaxy might operate – how the rules of the different planets
                        would vary and would there be — can there be — an operational civilization
                        in interstellar space. It’s fun to imagine, like Richard Feynman might have
                        said. Our diurnal rhythms, our 24-hours-per-day cycle, the months in our
                        years, the years in our centuries, and so forth, our Moon, our tides, our
                        seasons, our flora and fauna and our seasonal temperature variations are all
                        unique to our planet and unique to our unique combination of the Earth-Moon
                        system. Even Mars is way different. Bachelor parties on Mars are several
                        centuries away.
